Intern Pe AI/ML Internship Contribution

This repository contains my AI/ML contributions to InternPe, a company that helps students find internships. My contributions include:

## Task 1 [open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13EYmfOevXKLu3OnzXfL76lWbqtUzCPf4?usp=sharing)
Diabetes Prediction with ML
In this task , a diabetes csv file is used as a dataset provided by the Internpe Officials. We predict whether the patient is diabetic or not using python and predict the accuracy of the SVM algorithm.

## Task 2 [open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ibHUokuk7UVlDXgk6tqhuaoCnPNTVbfR?usp=sharing)
CAR PRICE Predictor with ML
In this task, A car csv file is used as a dataset provided by the InternPe officials. Here we study the dataset file using Python and predict the car price using ML algorithms.

## Task 3 [open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N2rHiHXpycob-4dkh1fh7M-C7ce-0rLM?usp=sharing)
IPL WINNING TEAM PREDICTION
In this task, Two csv files are used as a dataset provided by the InternPe officials. Here we study the dataset file using Python and predict the Winning IPL Team using ML algorithms.

## Task 4 [open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OWehOOmw0aD6Mv1yxJmijc5WGNcuoHGk?usp=sharing)
BREAST CANCER DETECTION
In this task, A csv files is used as a dataset provided by the InternPe officials. Here we study the dataset file using Python and predict the Breast Cancer using ML algorithms. Here we use the sklearn, a python library and load the data from sklearn
